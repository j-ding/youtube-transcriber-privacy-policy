## Summary

We collect minimal data necessary to provide our service. We do not sell your data or share it with third parties for advertising purposes. We do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extension's single purpose (downloading YouTube transcripts). We do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.

## 1. Information We Collect

YouTube Transcript Downloader collects the following information:

### Personally Identifiable Information
- **Email Address:** Used for account creation, authentication, and to identify your subscription plan.

### Authentication Information
- **Account Credentials:** Your email and password are used to authenticate your account. Passwords are securely hashed and stored via Supabase authentication services—we never store plaintext passwords.
- **Session Data:** We store session tokens locally to keep you logged in. For security, we enforce a single-session policy (logging in on a new device will log you out of previous devices).

### Website Content
- **YouTube Transcripts:** The extension accesses transcript/caption text from YouTube video pages that you choose to download. This content is processed locally in your browser and downloaded directly to your device. We do not store, transmit, or have access to the transcript content you download.

### Usage Information
- **Usage Data:** We track the number of transcripts downloaded to enforce plan limits (stored locally in your browser and/or on our server for premium users).
- **Subscription Status:** Your plan type (Free, Premium, or Lifetime) is stored to provide appropriate features.

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect or store the content of transcripts you download
- We do not track which YouTube videos you visit

Your information is used exclusively to:

- Authenticate your account

## 4. Data Storage

Your data is stored in the following ways:

- **Transcript Content:** Downloaded transcripts are saved directly to your device. We do not store or transmit transcript content to any server.

## 5. Third-Party Services
